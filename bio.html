<h1>About me</h1>
</div>
<p>I work at SonderMind as a Applied Scientist with a mission to redesign mental healthcare to make it easier to find and access therapy.</p>
<p>Before being a part of SonderMind, I put my efforts into cancer research. In that role, I applied my statistics and machine learning knowledge to help improve treatments for cancer patients and give better support to those who had survived cancer. Using what I learned from previous experience, I'm now focused on coming up with innovative ways to boost the quality of personalized clinical care.</p>
<p>I truly believe in the power of data and technology to make big changes in many parts of our lives, not just in healthcare. My goal is to be part of a movement that sees the value in improving all areas of human life, making sure everyone can live their best possible life.</p>
