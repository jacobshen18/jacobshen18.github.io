= About me

As an Applied Scientist in Healthcare, I use AI and machine learning to enhance healthcare delivery, making treatments more accessible and personalized to each individualâ€™s needs.

Previously, I worked in cancer research, applying statistical and machine learning techniques to improve treatment protocols and support cancer survivors. This experience inspired me to continue using technology to advance personalized clinical care.

I believe that data and technology can positively transform healthcare and improve lives. My goal is to help create a future where AI supports everyone in achieving their best possible health and well-being.
