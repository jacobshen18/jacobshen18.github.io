= About me

As a Senior Applied Statistician at SonderMind, I am committed to enhancing mental health access, utilization, and outcomes while diminishing the stigma surrounding mental health care by leveraging my expertise in applied science and machine learning. I obtained a B.S. in Mathematics from Xiamen University and an M.Sc. in Statistics from the University of California, San Diego.

Before joining SonderMind, I concentrated on cancer clinical trials and prevention research, where I employed my statistical knowledge and machine learning skills to drive progress in oncology treatments and improve the lives of cancer survivors. Building on this strong foundation in mathematical and statistical methodologies, I now dedicate myself to devising innovative solutions that elevate mental health care services.

I am deeply passionate about harnessing data-driven insights to bring about meaningful change and cultivate a more compassionate and empathetic society, wherein mental health is valued and understood as an essential aspect of overall well-being.
