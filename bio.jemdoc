= About me

I work at SonderMind as a Applied Statistician with a mission to improve mental health access, utilization and outcomes, and decrease the stigma of mental health care. I apply my strong skills in statistics and machine learning, including a bachelor degree in Mathematics from Xiamen University and a master's in Statistics from the University of California, San Diego.

Before being a part of SonderMind, I put my efforts into cancer research. In that role, I applied my statistical skills and machine learning knowledge to help improve treatments for cancer patients and give better support to those who had survived cancer. Using what I learned from that experience, I'm now focused on coming up with innovative ways to boost the quality of mental health care.

I truly believe in the power of data and technology to make big changes in many parts of our lives, not just in healthcare. My goal is to be part of a movement that sees the value in improving all areas of human life, making sure everyone can live their best possible life.
